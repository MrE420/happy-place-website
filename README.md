## Repository Information

This is a clean, optimized repository (28MB) that was created from the original repository (5.7GB) to reduce size by 99.5%. This size reduction was achieved by:

1. Creating a fresh Git repository with only the current state of files
2. Optimizing images and assets
3. Removing large binary files from Git history
4. Using proper .gitignore rules

This significantly improves clone times, storage requirements, and deployment speed.
